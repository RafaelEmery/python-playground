"""
The program should:
    Define a class Author with attributes:
    name (string)
    birth_year (integer)

Define a class Book with attributes:
    title (string)
    year (integer)
    author (an Author object)

Add the following methods:
    Book.get_info() → returns a string like "Book Title by Author Name"
    Author.write_book(title, year) → returns a new Book instance associated with that author

Bonus (optional):
    Let the author store all books they’ve written
    Add __str__() methods for nicer printing
    Add a method Author.get_bibliography() that prints all titles by the author

This project teaches you how to:
    Build multiple classes that reference each other
    Create object relationships
    Model simple real-world systems like authors and their books
