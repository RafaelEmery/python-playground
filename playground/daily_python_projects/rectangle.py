"""
The program should:
    Define a class named Rectangle

The class should have:
    Two instance attributes: width and height (set via the constructor)
    A method area() that returns the area of the rectangle
    A method perimeter() that returns the perimeter of the rectangle
    A method is_square() that returns True if width and height are equal

Bonus (optional):
    Add __str__() to print something like: Rectangle(4 x 5)
    Add input validation to ensure width and height are positive

This project introduces you to writing your own classes â€” a core concept in building reusable, modular, and real-world Python code.
