"""
Your task for today is to create a Python script that analyzes housing data from a CSV file. 
This project will give you hands-on practice with CSV reading, nested loops, and basic data analysis using Python's built-in tools.

The program should:
    Load the file sample_data/california_housing_test.csv located in the Colab Notebook files directory.
    Parse each row and store the data in a list of dictionaries

Calculate and display:
    The average median income
    The average median house value
    The highest income and the row it came from
    The total population in rows where median income > 6

Bonus (optional):
    Group rows by housing_median_age and calculate the average house value per age
    Let the user enter a minimum income value and filter the dataset accordingly

This project teaches you how to work with CSV files, iterate over rows, and extract useful insights 
from real data â€” an essential step for any aspiring data analyst or Python developer.

Expected Output:
    Loaded 3000 rows.
    Average Median Income: 3.87  
    Average Median House Value: $156,831.00  
    Highest Income: 15.0001 (Row 456)  
    Total Population (income > 6): 982,135
